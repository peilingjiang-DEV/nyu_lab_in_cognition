    "  <strong>Question 6</strong> <br>\n",
    "    Ok, so now you have performed the desired analysis for one subject.  You have computed eight numbers for that subject described above.  Now we want to repeat this for each subject. There are two ways to do this.  One is using the pandas groupby() function.  This is somewhat of the advanced mode version but if you do this you can probably perform the analysis in only 5-6 lines of code.  An alternative approach is to generalize the code you just wrote to use a for loop that iterates over each subject in the data frame.  Which ever way you choose you might find it helpful to refer to the <a href=\"http://gureckislab.org/courses/fall19/labincp/tips/fortyforloops.html\">Forty For Loops</a> notebook I provided which shows some example templates for using for loops to analyze individual subject data in pandas dataframes.  The end result is that you want a dataframe containing the d' and c for each subject for each stimulus condition.\n",

    "    Now that you have your summary statistics computed, our next step is to ask if the conditions are different on either the d' or c measure.  For now concentrate on the easiest and hardest conditions to see if there is a effect in the most dissimilar conditions.  Then compare the hardest and second hardest conditions. Conduct the appropriate t-test to tell if these conditions are different.  The chapter reading from this week has all the code you need.  However you might find it helpful to refer to the pingouin documentation for the <a href=\"https://pingouin-stats.org/generated/pingouin.ttest.html#pingouin.ttest\">t-test function</a>.\n",

    "  <strong>Question 8 (BONUS)</strong> <br>\n",
    "    This question is a bonus but asks you to verify the assumptions of the chosen t-test hold.  Usually this involves looking to see that the distribution of scores you are analyzing are roughly \"normally\" distributed.  The textbook showed a few example way to check including the histogram, the qqplot, and the Shapiro-Wilks test.  Perform this test on your data.  If the data seem very non-normal you might consider switching your t-test to the non-parametric alternative discussed in the chapter (the Wilcoxon or Mann-Whitney test).\n",
